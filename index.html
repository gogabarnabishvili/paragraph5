        <p>
            Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly <br />
            to succeed quickly. Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design
            <br />is ethical design. Designers are toolmakers. <br />
            Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br />
            Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
            <br />
            Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.
